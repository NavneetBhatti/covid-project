                   <h1>Travel advice</h1><hr>
                   <h2>Considering travel over the holidays? Take precautions to protect yourself from COVID-19.</h2>
                   <p>Is going home for the holidays feasible during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic? Get the facts about travel options and how to protect yourself.  </p>      
                   <h2>Before you travel</h2>
                   <p>As you think about making travel plans, consider these questions:</p>
                   <p> <h3>1.Is COVID-19 spreading at your destination?</h3> The more cases at your destination, the more likely you are to get infected during travel.</p>
                   <p><h3>2. Are you at increased risk for severe illness?</h3> Anyone can get COVID-19, but older adults and people of any age with certain medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</p>
                   <p><h3>3.Do you live with someone who's at increased risk for severe illness?</h3> If you get infected while traveling, you can spread the virus to the people you live with when you return, even if you don't have symptoms.</p>
                   <h2>Stay safe when you travel</h2>
                   <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends following these steps to protect yourself and others when you travel:</p>
                   <ul>
                     <liMaintain a distance of 6 feet (2 meters) between you and others as much as possible.></li>
                     <li>Avoid contact with anyone who is sick</li>
                     <li>Limit contact with frequently touched surfaces, such as handrails, elevator buttons and kiosks. If you must touch these surfaces, use hand sanitizer or wash your hands afterward.</li>
                     <li>Wear a cloth face mask.</li>
                     <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
                     <li>Cover coughs and sneezes.</li>
                     <li>Clean your hands often. It's especially important after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h2>Air travel</h2>
                   <p>Because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, most viruses don't spread easily on flights. However, crowded flights make social distancing difficult. Plus air travel involves spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people.

                    The CDC and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have issued guidance to help airlines prevent the spread of the coronavirus. As a result, most major airlines in the U.S. require that crews and passengers wear cloth face coverings. To see what specific airports and airlines are doing to protect passengers, check their websites.
                    
                    The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has increased cleaning and disinfecting equipment and surfaces at screening checkpoints. If you haven't flown since the pandemic began, you'll notice some changes:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>TSA officers wearing masks and gloves, and practicing social distancing.</li>
                      <li>TSA officers changing gloves after each pat-down.</li>
                      <li>Travelers may wear masks during screening. However, TSA employees may ask travelers to adjust masks for identification purposes.</li>
                      <li>Instead of handing boarding passes to TSA officers, travelers should place passes (paper or electronic) directly on the scanner and then hold them up for inspection.</li>
                      <li>Food items should be transported in a plastic bag and placed in a bin for screening. Separating food from carry-on bags lessens the likelihood that screeners will need to open bags for inspection.</li>
                      <li>Personal items such as keys, wallets and phones should be placed in carry-on bags instead of bins. This reduces the handling of these items during screening.</li>
                    </ul>
